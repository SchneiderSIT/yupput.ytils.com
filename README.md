# Ytils Yupput

Ytils Yupput is a JavaScript GUI component for your web-based applications or websites to open an input dialogue comparable to Apple's spotlight input.

Yupput is written in vanilla JavaScript and supports keyboard shortcuts to open the dialogue. Furthermore, Yupput can be customized quite generous over its API. However, you can - of course - simply override Yupput's CSS styles.
