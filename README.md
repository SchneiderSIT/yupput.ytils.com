## Building Yupput

Yupput uses Ytils' JsMrg (https://www.ytils.com/jsmrg) tool to combine the main development file ytils.yupput.js with the 
partial files from the lib folder. JsMrg ist bundled within this repository.

To run JsMrg you will need to have .NET Core 3.1 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/) or higher 
installed on your system.

Create an executable Bash file copy from build.template.sh and replace *&lt;version&gt;* with the version you want to 
build. Then execute your build-file copy.
